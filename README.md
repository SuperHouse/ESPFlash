ESPFlash Programming Header Pinout
==================================

ESPFlash is a convention for programming header connections to PCBs
designed with the Espressif ESP8266, ESP8285, and ESP32 MCUs.

The convention allows for both 1x6 and 2x3 format headers, in either
2.54mm (0.1") or 1.27mm (0.05") sizes.
